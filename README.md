# Smart Bus Pass with Biometric Authentication

A web based application for bus pass with biometric Authentication

## About

The Smart Bus Pass project is revolutionizing bus pass verification and improving user comfort, security, and operational efficiency in the public transportation sector. Through the use of a biometric password and their 12-digit Aadhar ID, users can log in securely with biometric authentication.This additional security layer lowers the possibility of fraudulent bus pass use and virtually eliminates unauthorized access. 

## Features

handle user registration. 
Easy way of pass renewal.
Finest user experience with biometric authentication.
Improved security layer.
Check the validity of the bus pass.

## Requirements

1. Requirements gathering
2. System Design 
3. Software Development 
4. Biometric Technology Integration 
5. Integration and Testing

## Result

Majority of the test cases pass successfully, demonstrating the system's ability to handle user registration, authentication, bus pass applications, renewals, and error scenarios effectively.
Error messages are appropriately triggered for invalid inputs, expired bus passes, and authentication failures, ensuring robust error handling and user feedback.
